# Silly Filters
An Outer Wilds mod that adds silly filters/overlays to scout images.
Spice up your wild ventures!

## How to use
You can select which filter to use in the mod's settings. By default, the filter is set to `none` (no filter is applied).
Select a filter. Now you can take a picture with any scout!

Current filters include:
- `postcard`
- `rainbow`
- `so cute`
- `hearts`

## Compatability
This mod is compatable and has been tested with these scout image-related mods:
- [Outer Pictures](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/outerpictures/)
- [Color Cameras](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/colorcameras/)
- [Épicas Album](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/picasalbum/)


This mod is **NOT** compatable with:
