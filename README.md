Spice up your wild ventures!

## How to use
You can select which filter to use in the mod's settings. By default, the filter is set to `none` (no filter is applied).
Select a filter. Now you can take a picture with any scout!

Current filters include:
- `postcard`
- `rainbow`
- `so cute`
- `hearts`
